We recommend capturing a full coredump trace in case the system encounters a
fatal problem, like a hard fault or a failed assertion. However, in some cases
it may not be desirable or possible to do so. For example, if stopping &
rebooting the system is not an option, or if the error is recoverable but you
would still like to understand how often it happens.

The
[trace event](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/trace_event.h)
module within the SDK makes it easy to track errors in a way that requires less
storage than full coredump traces and also allows the system to keep running
after capturing the event. Only the program counter, return address and a custom
"reason" are saved. Once uploaded to Memfault, each trace event will be
associated with an Issue just like a coredump.

Here's an example where Trace Events are captured for Bluetooth protocol CRC
errors and invalid message IDs:

### Defining Custom Trace Reasons

Aside from the program counter and return address, a trace event also contains a
user-defined "error reason". The list of custom reasons is defined in a separate
configuration file named `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` which you need
to create.

To start, we recommend adding a "test" trace error reason you can easily trigger
(i.e via a CLI command) and a couple for error paths in your codebase (such as
peripheral bus read/write failures, transport errors and unexpected timeouts).

Here is what the `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` file should look like:

```c
// memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(test)
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(your_custom_error_reason_1)
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(your_custom_error_reason_2)
// ...
```

### Adding Trace Events

Next, we'll need to use the `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_*` macros to capture trace
events when errors occur.

Note that it is perfectly fine to use the same reason in different places if
that makes sense in the context of your code. Because the program counter and
return address are captured in the trace event, you will be able to see the 2
topmost frames (function name, source file and line) in Memfault's Issue UI and
distinguish between the two.

For test purposes, you can add a CLI command that logs trace events using
different methods:

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"
// [ ...]
void test_trace_event_cli_cmd(void) {
    // Examples of the different flavors of Trace Events

    // 1. basic trace event- call site information and Trace Event Reason code
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(test);

    // 2. trace event with status code (i.e error code returned from stack),
    // providing additional context to the Trace Event
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS(test, 0xdeadbeef);

    // 3. trace event with a log of arbitrary data
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(test, "A trace event with log %d", 1);
}
```

You can also start to add trace events for error paths:

```c
#include "memfault/core/trace_event.h"
// [ ...]
void ble_le_process_ll_pkt(...) {
  // ...
  if (invalid_msg_id) {
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(bt_invalid_msg_id);
    // ...
  }
  // ..
}
```

For details on the trace event macros, see the
[header file](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.38.0/components/include/memfault/core/trace_event.h).

### Trace Event Variants

As shown above, there are a few different types of Trace Events available.

1. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT()` - a simple trace event, applying the Custom Trace
   Reason
2. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS()` - a trace event including an arbitrary
   user data value
3. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG()` - a trace event including a `printf`-like
   string (the formatter will use [Compact Logs](/docs/mcu/compact-logs) if
   enabled and supported on the platform).

Trace Events, like Coredumps, are de-duplicated to assign multiple Trace Events
to the same Issue. The de-duplication works as follows:

- Trace Events with the same Reason (and same Status code or no Status code) and
  same call frame (function where the Trace is called) will be de-duplicated
- Trace Events with the same Reason, Status code, and call frame, but different
  log message, will be de-duplicated. The log message is available from the
  individual Trace view.
- Trace Events with the same Reason and a different Status code will **not** be
  de-duplicated

### Recording Trace Events from Interrupts

It is also safe to use the `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT()` macro from an interrupt.
When called from an interrupt, the trace event info will be copied to a
temporary storage region in RAM to minimize interrupt latency. The collected
data can then be serialized to event storage by explicitly calling
`memfault_trace_event_try_flush_isr_event()`. The data will also be flushed
automatically anytime `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT()` is called and the processor is
**not** in an interrupt.
