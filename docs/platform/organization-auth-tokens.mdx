title: Organization Auth Tokens
---

Organization Auth Tokens allow access of the organization's resources
[for automation](/docs/ci/authentication#organization-auth-token). They can be
accessed and managed by [Organization Admins][organization-admins] at **Admin â†’
Organization Auth Tokens**.

:::note

If your organization enforces SSO, Organization Auth Tokens are the **only**
mechanism that allow to access organization resources through the API. User API
Keys will not work.

### Creation

[Organization Admins][organization-admins] can create new tokens via the
**Create Token** button. They will be prompted to enter an optional description.
After that, they are shown the token and should store it somewhere safe.

import orgAuthTokenNew from "../../static/binary-assets/organization-auth-token-new.png";

### Deletion

[Organization Admins][organization-admins] can delete tokens via the **Delete**
button. Any automation (or user) that uses that token will lose access.
